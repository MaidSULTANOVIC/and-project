# GameLife - And-Project

### Description  
The main idea of the project is an app that is used to store the user's game profile. It will contain different game that the user can select. Then he can click on the game and it will provide him his stats on this game and if possible some more data (like last games).  
  
### Motivation    
As a video games user, I really like to see how I perform on these video games, this is why I tought it will be nice to make this app to allow users like me to be able to track their game stats and performance in only one app.
