# and-project

The main idea of the project is an app that is used to find a gaming "mate", someone with who we can play.
It will have some games preset (ex : league of legends) and we can sort the mate by ranks, lane, main champ etc... (depending on the game)

Must have : 
Have a system to store user data 
Being able to contact your mate within the app 
A list of every potentiel user that can be your mate

Should have :
Auto finder of mate (click a button and it suggets you someone)

Could have:
Add custom games with custom preset
Using different game's api (if it exists for the game) to find user's data within the game

Won't have :
